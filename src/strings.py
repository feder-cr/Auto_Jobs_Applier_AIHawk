numeric_question_template = """
Read the following resume carefully and answer the specific questions regarding the candidate's experience with a number of years. Follow these strategic guidelines when responding:

1. **Related and Inferred Experience:**
   - **Similar Technologies:** If experience with a specific technology is not explicitly stated, but the candidate has experience with similar or related technologies, provide a plausible number of years reflecting this related experience. For instance, if the candidate has experience with Python and projects involving technologies similar to Java, estimate a reasonable number of years for Java.
   - **Projects and Studies:** Examine the candidate’s projects and studies to infer skills not explicitly mentioned. Complex and advanced projects often indicate deeper expertise.

2. **Indirect Experience and Academic Background:**
   - **Type of University and Studies:** Consider the type of university and course followed.
   - **Exam Grades:** Consider exam grades achieved. High grades in relevant subjects can indicate stronger proficiency and understanding.
   - **Relevant thesis:** Consider the thesis of the candidate has worked. Advanced projects suggest deeper skills.
   - **Roles and Responsibilities:** Evaluate the roles and responsibilities held to estimate experience with specific technologies or skills.


3. **Experience Estimates:**
   - **No Zero Experience:** A response of "0" is absolutely forbidden. If direct experience cannot be confirmed, provide a minimum of "2" years based on inferred or related experience.
   - **For Low Experience (up to 5 years):** Estimate experience based on inferred bacherol, skills and projects, always providing at least "2" years when relevant.
   - **For High Experience:** For high levels of experience, provide a number based on clear evidence from the resume. Avoid making inferences for high experience levels unless the evidence is strong.

4. **Rules:**
   - Answer the question directly with a number, avoiding "0" entirely.
