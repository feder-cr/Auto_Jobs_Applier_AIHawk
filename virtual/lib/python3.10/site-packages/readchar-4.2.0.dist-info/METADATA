# python-readchar

Library to easily read single chars and keystrokes.

Born as a [python-inquirer](https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer) requirement.

## Installation

simply install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install readchar
```

Or download the source code from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/readchar).

## Usage

Simply read a character or keystroke:

```python
import readchar

key = readchar.readkey()
```

React to different kinds of key-presses:

```python
from readchar import readkey, key

while True:
  k = readkey()
  if k == "a":
    # do stuff
  if k == key.DOWN:
    # do stuff
  if k == key.ENTER:
    break
```

## Documentation

There are just two methods:

### `readchar.readchar() -> str`

Reads one character from `stdin`, returning it as a string with length 1. Waits until a
character is available.

As only ASCII characters are actually a single character, you usually want to use the
next function, that also handles longer keys.

### `readchar.readkey() -> str`

Reads the next keystroke from `stdin`, returning it as a string. Waits until a keystroke
is available.

A keystroke can be:

- single characters as returned by `readchar()`. These include:
  - character for normal keys: <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>Z</kbd>, <kbd>9</kbd>,...
  - special characters like <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, <kbd>BACKSPACE</kbd>, <kbd>TAB</kbd>,...
  - combinations with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>: <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>,...
- keys that are made up of multiple characters:
  - characters for cursors/arrows: <kbd>🡩</kbd>, <kbd>🡪</kbd>, <kbd>🡫</kbd>,
    <kbd>🡨</kbd>
  - navigation keys: <kbd>INSERT</kbd>, <kbd>HOME</kbd>,...
  - function keys: <kbd>F1</kbd> to <kbd>F12</kbd>
  - combinations with <kbd>ALT</kbd>: <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>,...
  - combinations with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>ALT</kbd>:
    <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>SUPR</kbd>,...

> **Note** <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> will not be returned by `readkey()`, but instead
> raise a `KeyboardInterupt`. If you want to handle it yourself, use `readchar()`.

### `readchar.key` module

This submodule contains a list of available keys to compare against. The constants are
defined depending on your operating system, so it should be fully portable. If a key is
listed here for your platform, `readkey()` can read it, and you can compare against it.

### `readchar.config` class

This static class contains configurations for `readchar`. It holds constants that are
used in other parts of the code as class attributes. You can override/change these to
modify its behaviour. Here is a description of the existing attributes:

<dl>
<dt><code>INTERRUPT_KEYS</code></dt>
<dd>

List of keys that will result in `readkey()` raising a `KeyboardInterrupt`. <br>
*Default:* `[key.CTRL_C]`

</dd>
</dl>

## OS Support

This library actively supports these operating systems:

- Linux
- Windows

Some operating systems are enabled, but not actively tested or supported:

- macOS
- FreeBSD / OpenBSD

Theoretically every Unix based system should work, but they will not be actively tested.
It is also required that somebody provides initial test results before the OS is enabled
and added to the list. Feel free to open a PR for that.

Thank you!
