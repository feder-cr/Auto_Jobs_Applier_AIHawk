# Issues Reporting Guidelines

Welcome to the AI Hawk Contributing Guide and Issues Tracker! To keep things organized and ensure issues are resolved quickly, please follow the guidelines below when submitting a bug report, feature request, or any other issue.

If you have a general question, are curious about how something in Python works, please remember that [Google](https://google.com) is your friend and it can answer many questions.

This is a work in progress and you may encounter bugs.

The employers who you are applying to are not looking for candidates who need someone to hold their hand and do everything for them, they are not your parents, they are your potential boses; they will be expecting you to be able to solve simple problems on your own, the AI Hawk mods and devs expect the same of you.

Please do not beg in the issues tracker, discussions or chat.  We are not here to give you a job, we are here to provide you with a tool for you to go out and find a job on your own.  We will try to have instructions for all steps of the process, but you must read the docs, learn on your own, and understand that this is an open-source project run by volunteers.  It will require you to do some work of your own.

If you see something that needs to be documented, or some documentation which could be improved, submit a documentation request or document it yourself and submit a PR to help others understand how that part of the software functions and how to use it.

## Before You Submit an Issue

### 1. Search Existing Issues

Please search through the existing open issues and closed issues to ensure your issue hasn’t already been reported. This helps avoid duplicates and allows us to focus on unresolved problems.

### 2. Check Documentation

Review the README and any available documentation to see if your issue is covered.

Join us on [Telegram](https://t.me/AIhawkCommunity) to check with the community about issues and ask for help with issues.  If a dev, mod, contributor or other community member is available, a live conversation will likely resolve your small issues and configuration problems faster than using this issues tracker would.

### 3. Provide Detailed Information

If you are reporting a bug, make sure you include enough details to reproduce the issue. The more information you provide, the faster we can diagnose and fix the problem.

## Issue Types

### 1. Bug Reports

Please include the following information:

- **Description:** A clear and concise description of the problem.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
- **Expected Behavior:** What should have happened.

### 2. Feature Requests

For new features or improvements:

- Clearly describe the feature you would like to see.
- Explain the problem this feature would solve or the benefit it would bring.
- If possible, provide examples or references to similar features in other tools or platforms.

### 3. Questions/Discussions

- If you’re unsure whether something is a bug or if you’re seeking clarification on functionality, you can ask a question. The best place to ask a question is on [Telegram](https://t.me/AIhawkCommunity). If you are asking a question on GitHub, please make sure to label your issue as a question.

## Issue Labeling and Response Time

We use the following labels to categorize issues:

- **bug:** An issue where something isn't functioning as expected.
- **documentation:** Improvements or additions to project documentation.
- **duplicate:** This issue or pull request already exists elsewhere.
- **enhancement:** A request for a new feature or improvement.
- **good first issue:** A simple issue suitable for newcomers.
- **help wanted:** The issue needs extra attention or assistance.
- **invalid:** The issue is not valid or doesn't seem correct.
- **question:** Additional information or clarification is needed.
- **wontfix:** The issue will not be fixed or addressed.
- We aim to respond to issues as early as possible. Please be patient, as maintainers may have limited availability.

## Contributing Fixes

If you’re able to contribute a fix for an issue:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your fix.
2. Reference the issue number in your branch and pull request.
3. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of the changes and how they resolve the issue.
