## Configuration

### 1. secrets.yaml

This file contains sensitive information. Never share or commit this file to version control.

- `llm_api_key: [Your OpenAI or Ollama API key or Gemini API key]`
  - Replace with your OpenAI API key for GPT integration
  - To obtain an API key, follow the tutorial at: <https://medium.com/@lorenzozar/how-to-get-your-own-openai-api-key-f4d44e60c327>
  - Note: You need to add credit to your OpenAI account to use the API. You can add credit by visiting the [OpenAI billing dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing).
  - According to the [OpenAI community](https://community.openai.com/t/usage-tier-free-to-tier-1/919150) and our users' reports, right after setting up the OpenAI account and purchasing the required credits, users still have a `Free` account type. This prevents them from having unlimited access to OpenAI models and allows only 200 requests per day. This might cause runtime errors such as:  
    `Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. ...}}`  
    `{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for gpt-4o-mini in organization <org> on requests per day (RPD): Limit 200, Used 200, Requested 1.}}`  
    OpenAI will update your account automatically, but it might take some time, ranging from a couple of hours to a few days.  
    You can find more about your organization limits on the [official page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).

### PLUS. data_folder_example

The `data_folder_example` folder contains a working example of how the files necessary for the bot's operation should be structured and filled out. This folder serves as a practical reference to help you correctly set up your work environment for the job search bot.

#### Contents

Inside this folder, you'll find example versions of the key files:

- `secrets.yaml`
- `config.yaml`
- `plain_text_resume.yaml`

These files are already populated with fictitious but realistic data. They show you the correct format and type of information to enter in each file.

#### Using the data_folder_example

Using this folder as a guide can be particularly helpful for:

1. Understanding the correct structure of each configuration file
2. Seeing examples of valid data for each field
3. Having a reference point while filling out your personal files

## Usage

0. **Account language**
   To ensure the bot works, your account language must be set to English.

1. **Data Folder:**
   Ensure that your data_folder contains the following files:
   - `secrets.yaml`
   - `config.yaml`
   - `plain_text_resume.yaml`

2. **Output Folder:**
    Contains the output of the bot.
    - `data.json` results of the --collect mode
    - `failed.json` failed applications
    - `open_ai_calls.json` all the calls made to the LLM model
    - `skipped.json` applications that were skipped
    - `success.json` successful applications

    **Note:** `answers.json` is not part of the output folder and can be found in the root of the project. It is used to store the answers of the questions asked to the user. Can be used to update the bot with corrected answers. Search for `Select an option`, `0`, `Authorized`, and `how many years of` to verify correct answers.

3. **Run the Bot:**

   Auto_Jobs_Applier_AIHawk offers flexibility in how it handles your pdf resume:

- **Dynamic Resume Generation:**
  If you don't use the `--resume` option, the bot will automatically generate a unique resume for each application. This feature uses the information from your `plain_text_resume.yaml` file and tailors it to each specific job application, potentially increasing your chances of success by customizing your resume for each position.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

- **Using a Specific Resume:**
  If you want to use a specific PDF resume for all applications, place your resume PDF in the `data_folder` directory and run the bot with the `--resume` option:

  ```bash
  python main.py --resume /path/to/your/resume.pdf
  ```

- **Using the collect mode:**
  If you want to collect job data only to perform any type of data analytics you can use the bot with the `--collect` option. This will store in output/data.json file all data found from linkedin jobs offers.

  ```bash
  python main.py --collect
  ```

### Troubleshooting

#### 1. OpenAI API Rate Limit Errors

**Error Message:**

openai.RateLimitError: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors>.', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', 'param': None, 'code': 'insufficient_quota'}}

**Solution:**

- Check your OpenAI API billing settings at <https://platform.openai.com/account/billing>
- Ensure you have added a valid payment method to your OpenAI account
- Note that ChatGPT Plus subscription is different from API access
- If you've recently added funds or upgraded, wait 12-24 hours for changes to take effect
- Free tier has a 3 RPM limit; spend at least $5 on API usage to increase

#### 2. Easy Apply Button Not Found

**Error Message:**

Exception: No clickable 'Easy Apply' button found

**Solution:**

- Ensure that you're logged properly
- Check if the job listings you're targeting actually have the "Easy Apply" option
- Verify that your search parameters in the `config.yaml` file are correct and returning jobs with the "Easy Apply" button
- Try increasing the wait time for page loading in the script to ensure all elements are loaded before searching for the button

#### 3. Incorrect Information in Job Applications

**Issue:** Bot provides inaccurate data for experience, CTC, and notice period

**Solution:**

- Update prompts for professional experience specificity
- Add fields in `config.yaml` for current CTC, expected CTC, and notice period
- Modify bot logic to use these new config fields

#### 4. YAML Configuration Errors
